# Spectral-Diagram
The Spectral Diagram (SD) is a new tool for the comparison of time series in the frequency domain. The SD provides a novel way to display the coherence function, power, amplitude, phase, and skill score of discrete frequencies of two time series. Each SD summarises these quantities in a single plot for multiple targeted frequencies.
